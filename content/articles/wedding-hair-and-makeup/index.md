Once you've narrowed down your list of potential salons, it's time to schedule consultations. A consultation gives you the opportunity to meet with a stylist, discuss your vision for your wedding day look, and get a sense of their style and approach.

During the consultation, be sure to bring along any inspiration photos you've collected and be open and honest about what you're looking for. Ask questions about the stylist's experience with wedding hair and makeup and inquire about their pricing and availability. This is also a great time to ask for a trial run to see how you'll look on your wedding day.
