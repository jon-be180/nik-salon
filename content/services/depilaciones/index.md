## Is waxing or laser hair removal better for me?

Waxing is a popular choice for many people because it is an affordable and effective method of removing hair. The process involves using hot or cold wax to remove hair from the root. This method is suitable for most skin types and can be performed on any part of the body.

Laser hair removal, on the other hand, is a more permanent solution. It uses laser technology to target and destroy hair follicles, preventing them from growing back. While laser hair removal can be more expensive than waxing, it provides long-lasting results and is ideal for those looking for a more permanent solution.

## What is the process of electrolysis hair removal like?

Electrolysis is a hair removal method that uses a small needle to deliver a low-level electrical current to the hair follicle. This destroys the hair at the root, preventing it from growing back. Electrolysis can be used on any part of the body, including the face, legs, arms, and intimate areas. Our beauty technicians are highly trained in the latest electrolysis techniques to provide you with the most effective and pain-free experience.

## How long does sugaring last compared to waxing?

Sugaring is a form of hair removal that uses a sticky, sugar-based paste to remove hair from the root. This method is similar to waxing, but it is less painful and more gentle on the skin. Sugaring can last anywhere from 4-6 weeks, while waxing can last up to 8 weeks.
