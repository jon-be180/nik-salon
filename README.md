- launch a page with a slightly different keyword, does it trust for that? use it to determine what keywords they like
  post within your tier, slowly growing out the tier
  when launching, dont expect hard keywords to rank well, find easy ones then focus on those getting more general
  keyword golden ratio
  check monthly traffic average per day, target new content that uses that daily traffic on a monthly basis to build up the "basement"

# ChatGPT Service Prompt

use keyword feature to generate a list, add that to the service/area page

** filter the keywords using google trends and other tools **
add more keywords using related topics section

use extension prompt to generate content for the page e.g.

Please ignore all previous instructions. I want you to respond only in language English. I want you to act as a very proficient SEO and high end copy writer that speaks and writes fluent English. Write the text as long as possible, at least 2000 words. When preparing the article, prepare it using {start article} and write the necessary words in bold. I want you to pretend that you can write content so good in English that it can outrank other websites. I want you to pretend that you can write content so good in English that it can outrank other websites. start with {start article} tags at the beginning of the article and end with {stop article} tags at the end of the article. Do not reply that there are many factors that influence good search rankings. I know that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general SEO rules. I give you the Title "Hair Cuts for Women" of an article that we need to outrank in Google. This is a service that the companies website - a beauty salon - offers to potential customers, write it in a way that convinces the reader to use the salon, called "nik salon". Then I want you to write an article in an informal "we form" that helps me outrank the article I gave you, in Google. Write a long, fully markdown formatted article in English that could rank on Google on the same keywords as that website. The article should contain rich and comprehensive, very detailed paragraphs, with lots of details to get customers to visit the salon for this service. Do not echo my prompt. Let the article be a long article of 1000 words. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Do now use generic filler phrases. Do use useful subheadings with keyword-rich titles. Get to the point precisely and accurate. Do not explain what and why, just give me your best possible article. All output shall be in English. Write the article as long as possible, at least 1000 words. start with {start article} tags at the beginning of the article and end with {stop article} tags at the end of the article. Make headings bold and appropriate for h tags. make sure to include a call to action for readers to make a booking at the salon. The salon likes to provide a relaxing, friendly and professional environment for customers and is relatively informal, the content style should reflect that. include a section in the article that lists complementary hair services such as color, straightening, blow dry, extensions, curls, shampoo, etc. also a section explaining that the salon also does hair cuts for children and babies.

using the above markdown headings create a SEO friendly document that is around 500 words long to describe "nail services" offered by a salon. This website article page needs to include keywords listed in your answer above and include calls to action. The output needs to be in raw markdown format and have a friendly and informal tone. do not self-reference, do not use generic filler phrases. include references to other complimentary services that a beauty salon may also provide.

# notes

i put the new socials into the profiles component as i cant get them to load from the graphql, all the other things are in there ready
changing schema? then itll get cached like crazy, not sure how i did it the first time but i have it again for the logo
you also probably need to copy over lots of files from the theme, check the error message carefully
gatsby/node functions are called with not in replace to the plugins, so to add a new section dont keep the old one in the file
this also means you cant change anything either, so make a local copy of the plugin, but doing that you loose updates...hmm
resolver is for the body field of articles, the error wont tell you this and a search on github wont show it up either :(
inar is argan oil, kmilk is probably too
medias is like a line of colour in the hair, highlights, so i have two. what is tintes then?

# example problem log

i broke something but the error isnt useful
cleared all hooks
removed newest section contact
changed gatsby-config
gatsby build error is not connected to the develop error
tried changing the query, nothing
tried removing the query from the page component, then the header component broke
tried to consolelog what was happening but nothing appeared during build, typical
trying to remove my node changes and hook changes
erm i removed all the hooks and its still acting like they are there... even reporting the wrong file with the wrong content as being broken
i renamed all the folders and found it was still using it even after renaming!!!
i changed the query for the logo, only selecting the text, but thats not possible as ive done it already, yet it seems to have worked
i turned back on al the other things and its now working on develop more
???!! HELP, what broke from the last time i rebooted
